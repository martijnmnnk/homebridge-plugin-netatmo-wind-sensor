## Homebridge Plugin for the Netatmo Wind Gauge

This plugin has been forked from the [Homebridge Plugin for the Netatmo Rain Sensor](https://github.com/chefhl/homebridge-plugin-netatmo-rain-sensor).

This Homebridge Plugin makes the Netatmo Wind Gauge accessible to HomeKit as a Switch or Leak Sensor.
This makes it possible to use the Netatmo Wind Gauge for all kinds of automations based on wind speed detection. 

Big Thank You to [chefhl](https://github.com/chefhl) for creating the Rain Sensor plugin.
